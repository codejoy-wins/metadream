        Metadreamer Universal Update Function of the Self-Simulation
    </h1>
    <p>
        Nicolas Bostrom's simulation theory is strangely attractive, but it cannot be the truth because it only explains that our world is probably simulated, but it doesn't explain the true universe itself, or base reality.  Christopher Langan's CTMU (Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe) is more intriguing because it attempts to explain the actual universe.

        The paper I looked at in preporation of this webpage is The Self-Simulation Hypothesis Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics

        Even if Bostrom's regular simulation theory is true,  we humans would naturally want to know more about this base reality.  If this is fake than what is real?  Therefore any model of reality that will satisfy us must focus on explaining base reality.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Self-Simulation Hypothesis does just this, and shares a lot in common with Langan's CTMU.  In this set of theories, reality is a simulation, but it doesn't come from some other reality.  We're not in a computer that's in a reality somewhere else.  We're in the computer that is from nowhere else.  This is real, but it's also a simulation.  We're in a simulated universe that comes from itself.  A self-simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this webpage, I'm going to demonstrate the proof that we are a simulation, using the concept and observation of quantum Entanglement as proof.  But then, we must also choose which time of simulation we are in as consequence of the proof.  We cannot be in a base physical reality, because quantum Entanglement breaks the laws of physics and moves faster than the speed of light.  We therefore are in a simulation, and any simulation thoery that posits an outside reality must also explain that outside reality, or else it is pointless. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we must be in a self-simulated universe.  And we must choose Between Langan's CTMU and the Self-Simulation Hypothesis.

        <p>You can see that by changing the bottom's speed the top one will change at the same time the bottom is changed.  This is similar to quantum Entanglement.  In fact, because the page is updated top to bottom, by changing the bottom one you actually finish changing it's entangled particle before you finish changing the bottom one.  So not only does the top entagled particle know it's partner has been changed, but it also can finish changing before it's partner does.  It's faster than time itself.</p>
        <p>
            It's not that doing something to one, then causes a line of communication from one to the other.  Rather, doing something to one is already doing something to the other, and they are both instantiations of the same variable.  So any change done to one is immediately change done to the other, even ahead of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I change the spin on one particle, it's entagled particle can finish changing before it's parner is finished.  This implies that it is not the particle talking to the other particle directly, but rather a direct intelligence that keeps track of the variables in nature,  This direct intelligence or outer intelligence is notified of the change to it's variable, and reupdates the universe with all instantiations of that variable now changed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, the universe that allows this phenomenon of quantum Entanglement must be based on information and in a simulation because the only way for quantum entanglement to work is for both instantiations to be getting their state from outside of this universe, or a grand thought as the self-simulation theory would say.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a quantum entangled particle can finish changing, before it's parner is even finished, or at the same time, then that means the quantum particle must be governed by an update function in a simulation where the universe was overwritten with new information.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In this update function it would run every second, let's say.  And everysecond, that which is unchanged remains the same, and that which has been changed triggers and update.  Or, it could be that the entire universe is popped out and into existance again with updated variables or instantiations.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the frequency of existance, or vibration of existance, is the universal update function that applies one change, to all it's entangled particles, every time anything happens.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea that nothing moves faster than the speed of light should be restated as nothing physical moves faster than the speed of light.  However, information, can move faster than the speed of light, because the entire universe itself is vibrating in and out of existance for every inch that light is travelling.  And within any of those updates information from one spot in the universe can affect another spot of the universe across galaxies before the light even makes it 1 foot of distance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only does the universe have a frequency of existance faster than the speed of light, but light is the basis of that frequency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Light travelling through space and time -- A light instant, how how far a light goes in the smallest amount of time, is the vibration of the universe.  In order for a physical light to move at all, the universe must update its state.  Therefore, The universe updates it's state infinitely.  An infinitely small amount of time measures the infinitely small amount of ditance light travels in a vacuum. The change you cause in the universe triggers and update, and then that change is calculated into the next update of the universe, faster than the speed of light.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The speed of Life is faster than the speed of light.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you could pause it, and you could look at the state of the universe - the changes within the current moment that will be put into the next state of the universe, and you could predict the next state based on the current changes, however, you cannot predict this out infinitely because the changes to the universe are made by free will consciousness.  Our free will changes the universe in an unpredictable way.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can pause the universe but you cannot know what will happen in the far future.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are waves of possiblities but they only become particles in the present moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The universal update funciton of the self-simulated universe is affected by conscious participation of its inhabitants.  We participate in this universal update function each moment we are conscious or in someone else's consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclustion, our observations of quantum entanglement moving information faster than the speed of light prove our universe is a simulation.  Since we cannot explain the base reality that created this simulation we must conclude we are the creators of our own self-simulation, like a metadream, and the fate of our universe depends on our conscious choices, not on someone in another reality turning off the computer we're on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if we, in the future, created a total simulation with simulated conscious inhabitants, their universe would be shaped by them, and would therefore be just as real as ours.  Even if we pulled the plug on them, they may just keep on dreaming.
